# Universal CLS-neuron adapter

This directory contains a single score-space adapter shared by LaGoVAD, DeSC, and DSANet on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. Each evaluation accepts only the current baseline's score stream; scores from another baseline are never inputs. A neuron is exactly one coordinate of a CLIP ViT-B/16 CLS hidden state. The adapter uses no optical flow or patch tokens.

The current hypothesis trains a lightweight correction head from high-confidence pseudo labels produced by the current baseline's own training scores. CLS-neuron evidence weights positive pseudo labels and gates temporal event propagation. The same network, loss, epochs, seed, and inference parameters are used for every baseline and dataset. All six evaluations use strict 16-frame snippet expansion and write only below `../vadmy_data/universal_neuron_adapter`.

Run remotely from the repository root with:

```bash
bash universal_neuron_adapter/commands/run_all.sh
```
